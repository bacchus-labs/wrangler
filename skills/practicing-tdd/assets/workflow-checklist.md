# TDD Workflow Checklist

Copy this checklist for each function you implement:

## RED Phase
- [ ] Write failing test FIRST
- [ ] Run test and watch it FAIL
- [ ] Verify failure message is correct
- [ ] Confirm you understand what to implement

## GREEN Phase
- [ ] Write minimal code to pass test
- [ ] Run test and watch it PASS
- [ ] Verify test passes for right reason
- [ ] Do not add extra features yet

## REFACTOR Phase
- [ ] Improve code quality
- [ ] Remove duplication
- [ ] Enhance readability
- [ ] Run tests again (should still pass)

## Certification
- [ ] Document in TDD Compliance table
- [ ] Record test file and line number
- [ ] Note if you watched fail/pass
- [ ] Explain any deviations
